<!-- Section One: Population Breakdown -->
<h2> 1. Population Breakdown by Religious Groups </h2>
<text> Singapore is growing year on year, mainly attributed by the citizen population growth. By June 2020, there were 3.52 million Singapore citizens (Strategy Group, 2020). According to the 2015 General Household Survey, majority of the Chinese population either practise Buddhism or has no religion, with about 21% belonging to the Catholic or Other Christians categories. On the other hand, while most Indians are Hindu, many among the Indian population are either Muslims or Christians. Perhaps the most interesting composition is that of the Malays, who almost exclusively belong to the Islam category. Over the years, although the citizen birth per Malay female citien is standing at one of the highest amongest the ethnic groups, it does not contribute to the largest fraction of Islams <i>(ibid)</i>. </text>
<br>
<br>
<text> The diverse multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, and multi-religious population has definitely undergone through tedious planning and governance to ensure inter-religious harmony in a dense Singapore city-state (CLC, 2020). To cater to the religious diversity of the Singapore population with impartiality and neutrality, urban planners and policymakers have a role to help maintain public order between opposing groups, in which one way includes safeguarding land parcels for the various religious groups to conduct their religious activities (Neo, 2019). Thus, places of worship like temples, mosques and churches can be found in every town in Singapore. </text>
<br>
<br>
<text> In addition to allocating sufficient land to the various religious groups, especially in highly religious pluralistic society like Singapore, the harmony and co-existence of the different religious groups and Places of Worships (PWs) are equally important when there are plurality of these nodes. Therefore, this study aims to focus on spatial locations of PWs against the density of population that practices religiously. </text>
