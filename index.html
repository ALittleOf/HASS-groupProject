<!-- Introduction -->
<div class="words">
	<p>Singapore is growing year on year, mainly attributed by the citizen population growth. By June 2020, there were 3.52 million Singapore citizens (Strategy Group, 2020). 
	Over the years, although the citizen birth per Malay female citien is standing at one of the highest amongest the ethnic groups, it does not contribute to the largest fraction of Islams <i>(ibid)</i>. </p>
	<p>The diverse multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, and multi-religious population has definitely undergone through tedious planning and governance to ensure inter-religious harmony in a dense Singapore city-state (CLC, 2020).
	To cater to the religious diversity of the Singapore population with impartiality and neutrality, urban planners and policymakers have a role to help maintain public order between opposing groups, in which one way includes safeguarding land parcels for the various religious groups to conduct their religious activities (Neo, 2019).
	Thus, places of worship like temples, mosques and churches can be found in every town in Singapore.</p>
	<p>In addition to allocating sufficient land to the various religious groups, especially in highly religious pluralistic society like Singapore, the harmony and co-existence of the different religious groups and Places of Worships (PWs) are equally important when there are plurality of these nodes.
	Therefore, this study aims to focus on spatial locations of PWs against the density of population that practices religiously.</p>

<!-- Section One: Religious Population by Ethnic Group -->
<h2> 1. Religious Composition by Ethnic Group </h2>
<h3>Hint: Hover over bars for proportion percentages</h3>
<!-- Create a div where the graph will take place -->
<div id="my_barchart"></div>
<div class="words">
	<p>The stacked bar chart above compares the religious composition of the four main ethnic groups in Singapore (Chinese, Malays, Indians, Others). From the chart, majority of
	the Chinese population are either Buddhist or have no religion, with about 21% belonging to Christianity. On the other hand, almost all Malays hold Islam beliefs. While most Indians are
	Hindu, there are many Muslims and Christians among the Indian population as well.</p>
	<p>Next, to compare among the population sizes of the major religions, a different chart was plotted.</p>

<!-- Section Two: Religious Population by Size -->

<h2>2. Population Sizes of Major Religious Groups </h2>
<h3>Hint: Hover over the bubbles to find out which are the largest religious groups! Drag the bubbles around for side-by-side comparisons.</h3>

<div id="my_dataviz"></div>

<div class="words">
	<p>The circle/ bubble chart above shows the relative sizes of each major religion in Singapore. Based on the size of the bubbles, it can be seen that the top three largest religious groups are 
	Buddhism, Christianity and Islam.</p>
	<p>Next, a choropleth map for each of these religions is created to discover the spatial distribution of the corresponding population.</p>
</div>

<h2>3. Choropleth Map of Religion Population Proportions (by Planning Area)</h2>
<h3>Hint: Click on each button to see that religion's population spatial distribution. Hover over each planning area to reveal the proportion. You may even pan and zoom too.</h3>
<h3>Hint 2: Click on the second row of buttons to show (or hide) the locations of the places of worship for each religion, then hover over each point to see the names of these places.</h3>
<h3>Note: The Buddhist and Taoist populations were combined as the Chinese temples dataset sourced did not distinguish between the two religions.</h3>

<div class="words">
	<p>The team notes that data is only available for 27 out of the 55 planning areas, and data for populated places like Newton, Orchard and River Valley are missing, perhaps because most of the residences
	there are private properties.</p>
	<p>Regardless, from the map above, it can be seen that the Buddhist and Taoist populations are spread rather evenly across Singapore, with Ang Mo Kio, Hougang and Sengkang having the highest population proprtions.
	The Islam population generally live along the peripheral regions of the island, with Tampines and Woodlands having the highest proportions. For the Christians, they tend to be concentrated within the 
	central and Southern regions of Singapore, with Bukit Timah and Tanglin having the highest proportions.</p>
	<p>Interestingly, when the places of worship are overlaid on the map, we see that they tend to congregate around the Southern-Eastern regions of Singapore, even though the population proportion of certain religious groups may not be the highest in those areas.</p>
	<p>For Buddhism/Taoism, while the cluster of temples located at the Southern-Eastern regions (Bukit Merah, Kallang, Geylang) seem to correspond with the relatively high population proportion living there, the other more populous areas have disproportionately fewer temples located within them. These areas include Ang Mo Kio, Sengkang and Jurong West.</p>
	<p>For Christianity, the relationship between the two distributions is even more tenuous. For example, the areas with the highest Christian proportions, Bukit Timah and Tanglin, have disproportionately fewer churches than less populous areas like Geylang, which have a lot more churches located there.</p>
	<p>Compared to these two major religions, the correlation between the two distributions for Islam is more pronounced, as evident from the cluster of mosques around the Eastern edges of Singapore (Geylang, Bedok), which happens to have a relatively high proportion of Malay population. Conversely, the central regions of Singapore also have fewer mosques, 
	which coincide with the lower population proportion in those areas.</p>
